# Gini by social determinants - Toronto
This repo contains data used in our paper titled "Increasing concentration of COVID-19 by socioeconomic determinants and geography in Toronto, Canada: an observational study".

## Abstract
Background: Inequities in the burden of COVID-19 were observed early in Canada and around the world suggesting economically marginalized communities faced disproportionate risks.  However, there has been limited systematic assessment of how heterogeneity in risks has evolved in large urban centers over time.  

Purpose: To address this gap, we quantified the magnitude of risk heterogeneity in Toronto, Ontario from January-November, 2020 using a retrospective, population-based observational study using surveillance data. 

Methods: We generated epidemic curves by social determinants of health (SDOH) and crude Lorenz curves by neighbourhoods to visualize inequities in the distribution of COVID-19 and estimated Gini coefficients. We examined the correlation between SDOH using Pearson-correlation coefficients. 

Results: Gini coefficient of cumulative cases by population size was 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI]:0.36-0.47) and estimated for: household income (0.20, 95%CI: 0.14-0.28); visible minority (0.21, 95%CI:0.16-0.28); recent immigration (0.12, 95%CI:0.09-0.16); suitable housing (0.21, 95%CI:0.14-0.30); multi-generational households (0.19, 95%CI:0.15-0.23); and essential workers (0.28, 95%CI:0.23-0.34). 

Conclusions: There was rapid epidemiologic transition from higher to lower income neighbourhoods with Lorenz curve transitioning from below to above the line of equality across SDOH. Moving forward necessitates integrating programs and policies addressing socioeconomic inequities and structural racism into COVID-19 prevention and vaccination programs.

### Gini coefficient of COVID-19 cases over time by income ([Figure 4](https://github.com/mishra-lab/cihr-multiprovince-covid-project/blob/main/publications/Gini%20by%20social%20determinant%20-%20Toronto/fig4.png))
This [dataset](https://github.com/mishra-lab/cihr-multiprovince-covid-project/blob/main/publications/Gini%20by%20social%20determinant%20-%20Toronto/d_after_tax_income_PPE_decile.zip) includes Gini coefficients of community cases (excluding long-term care residents) reported between January 21, 2020 and November 21, 2020 in Toronto stratified by income. Person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from Contact Management Solutions (CCM)+. Individual-level data have been transformed into aggregated data in the posted dataset.

This [dataset](https://github.com/mishra-lab/cihr-multiprovince-covid-project/blob/main/publications/Gini%20by%20social%20determinant%20-%20Toronto/d_multi_generation_decile.zip) includes Gini coefficients of community cases (excluding long-term care residents) reported between January 21, 2020 and November 21, 2020 in Toronto stratified by percentage of multi-generational household. Person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from Contact Management Solutions (CCM)+. Individual-level data have been transformed into aggregated data in the posted dataset. The measure of multi-generational household was curated by and sourced from the Ontario Community Health Profiles Partnership.

The datasets mentioned above include the following information organized by deciles:
* Total population in each decile (total_pop)
* Total cumulative cases at each decile (total_cum)
* Proportion of the population (X)
* Proportion of cases in the population (Y)

The Gini coefficient is calculated using the following formula:
* GINI = abs(A-B), where:
* A = sum[X(i) * Y(i+1)]
* B = sum[X(i+1) * Y(i)]
* X(i+1) = lag(X(i))
* Y(i+1) = lag(Y(i))
